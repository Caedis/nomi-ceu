[![Curseforge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_594351_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu)  
Port of [Nomifactory](https://github.com/Nomifactory/Nomifactory) 1.3 to the [GregTech CE Unofficial](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) generation of GT mods, with updated quests, progression and minor balance changes to adapt to CEu's changes.
- Overhauled circuit progression closely following CEu stock 
- Multiblock versions of nearly all machines, including EBF, Freezer and DT, processing up to 256 recipes in parallel
- New processing chains for Naquadah, Advanced SMDs, Crystal Chips, and more
- Fixed lots of unpleasant CE-ness - no more stupid Amp system, different ore stone types don't clog up your inventory, etc.
- Super-performant emissive effects on machines, coil blocks, the Fusion Reactor, and more
- Updated questbook to guide you through all the new stuff
- lots more...

Installation instructions for building the bleeding-edge version:
- Download the repository as a ZIP.
- Import it into your launcher of choice.
